# MarkLogic State Conductor DHF5 Example Project

This project demonstrates how the _State Conductor_ can be used to execute [Data Hub Framework](https://docs.marklogic.com/datahub/) flows.  The State Conductor includes "action" modules for executing full DHF flows, or the individual steps of a DHF flow.  See the included test data for example State Conductor state machine definitions which invoke DHF flows.
